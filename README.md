# Django Twitter
This is my capstone project for cs6019

# Introduction:
This project is inspired by social media "Twitter", I will try to rebuild back-end of Twitter based on Python and Django Framework. The finished version of this project will have a Django admin to let user manage users, tweets(avatars and tweetphotos), add comments and likes. And some features to improve user's experience like notification and pagination.
